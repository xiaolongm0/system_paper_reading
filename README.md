In the computer science area, the most important research papers are usually published on conferences. In computer system research, there are many different top level conferences for different sub-areas. The papers on these conferences are highly-recognized and obtain higher quality. Reading papers from these conference can benifit a lot for researchers.

I usually refer this [page](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~dan/index_sysvenues_deadline.html) for the important confernece deadlines.
